# lnurl-nfc
A library to help interacting with Web NFC to handle LNURLw payments

## Example
For an example how to use, see [example/src/index.ts](example/src/index.ts).

In order to run the example page run the following commands:

```
npm install
npx webpack
```

`example/dist/index.html` will then contain the example page to run in your browser. 

Note that the NFC functionality will almost only work on Android in Chrome, when hosted with https.
